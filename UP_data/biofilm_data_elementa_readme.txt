Context: 
Function and structure of biofilm colonizing contaminant exposure substrate (CES) cups amended with Cu and Ni. The experiment was conducted in two streams and at each stream two sediment types with 4 metal treatments each were used.  Each treatment was replicated 6x for a total of 96 experimental units.

Temporal coverage:
The experiment was conducted in July-Aug. 2010.  Biofilms were allowed to colonize CES for 4 weeks.  Salmon-Trout River: 21 July 2010-17 August 2010. Big Pup Creek: 20 July 2010-18 Aug. 2010.

Geographic coverage:
Dead Kelsey Watershed, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA
Salmon-Trout River: 46°46.96 N, 87°52.63 W
Big Pup Creek: 46°42.65 N, 87°42.31 W

Data codes:
BP - Big Pup Creek
