Context: 
Abundance of macroinvertebrate families colonizing sediments amended with Cu and Ni. The experiment was conducted in two streams and at each stream two sediment types with 4 metal treatments each were used.  Each treatment was replicated 3x for a total of 48 experimental units.

Temporal coverage:
The experiment was conducted in July-Aug. 2010.  Macroinvertebrates were allowed to colonize baskets for 4 weeks.  Salmon-Trout River: 21 July 2010-17 August 2010. Big Pup Creek: 20 July 2010-18 Aug. 2010.

Geographic coverage:
Dead Kelsey Watershed, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA
Salmon-Trout River: 46°46.96 N, 87°52.63 W
Big Pup Creek: 46°42.65 N, 87°42.31 W

Data codes:
LB – “Low binding” sediment from Alder Creek
HB – “High binding” sediment from Salmon-Trout River
EPT - The orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera
NA – Sample lost, data not available
